Hi, I am a senior researcher in [Deep Learning Group](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/deep-learning-group/) at Microsoft Research, Redmond, directed by [Dr. Jianfeng Gao](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jfgao/). My research interests span in computer vision, vision & language and machine learning. More specifically, my primary researches are about structured visual understanding at different levels and how to further leverage them for intelligent interactions with human through language and environment through embodiment. I believe, by integrating fine-grained structured information, we can achieve better yet interpretable, grounded and robust multi-modality intelligent agent.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from School of Interactive Computing at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu). I was supervised by [Prof. Devi Parikh](https://cc.gatech.edu/~parikh/) and worked closely with [Prof. Dhruv Batra](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~dbatra/). My thesis topic is "Structured Visual Understanding, Generation and Reasoning". Here is my old [GT homepage](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~jyang375/).

**If you are interested in working with me as a research intern, please feel free to drop me an email through jianwei.yang at microsoft dot com or jw2yang at gatech dot edu.**
